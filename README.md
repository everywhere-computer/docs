# Welcome to ϵ✵

The **Everywhere Computer (**[**ϵ✵**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]**)** is a network of portable and durable computation, with payment included. It lets you write complex code that runs _everywhere_ — your local machine, proprietary hyperclouds, and everything in between.

When you choose the Everywhere Computer, you choose the ability to:

✵ **Run** your own node or rent from the network\
✵ **Write** functions in Rust, JS, ++\
✵ **Compose** functions and workflows written by others\
✵ **Extend** the network's capabilities with any UCAN[^2]-enabled service

## How do I know if the Everywhere Computer is right for my project?

Do you write code that is accessed over a network? The Everywhere Computer may be right for you. But, of course, you probably already have ways of doing this. So why choose the Everything Computer?&#x20;

Choose the Everywhere Computer when your project is threatened by:

✵ **Network Starved Environments:** Because the Everywhere Computer runs local-first, you can continue to process compute at the edge with the compute resources you have at hand. When network uplink comes back online, that'll just become smoother and faster.\
✵ **Widely Dispersed Data Gravity:** A lot of data in one spot becomes cumbersome to move. We call that "data gravity". The Everywhere Computer's lets compute move to your data, instead of the other way around.\
✵ **Bandwidth Constraints:** Sometimes you simply can't run all the analysis you need on your data at the edge. The Everything Computer can be used to pre-process and select only the most important bits to send over the wire when bandwidth is scarce.\
✵ **Slow or Expensive Blockspace:** Blockchains are fantastic for _certain_ things that need global, timely consensus. For everything else, the Everything Computer can help you achieve the verifiability your project needs at a fraction of the time and cost.

Choose the Everywhere Computer when your project needs:

✵ **Multi-cloud Deployments:** Do regulations require you to be deployed to multiple cloud providers? Portability of the Everywhere Computer enables your company to make better use of resources and deploy a single codebase to multiple targets.\
✵ **Mission Critical Reliability:** Control systems in mission critical environments will benefit from the Everywhere Computer's durability and replayability. You'll gain the confidence that your software is resilient to outages and protected against data loss.\
✵ **Community Maintenance:** todo\
✵ **Reproducible Computation:** todo\
✵ **Credible Exit:** todo

## Who participates in the Everywhere Computer?

There are many ways to get involved:

✵ **Node Runners:** run a Homestar node on your home machine or personal cloud account as we boot up the network\
✵ **Rustaceans:** try your hand at writing IPVM functions. They compile to Wasm and can be run by anyone in the network.\
✵ **Front-End Devs:** Get backend capabilities that run local-first, on your users' devices — but run at scale on the Everywhere Computer when needed.

## How do I get started?

But the easiest way to answer all your questions is to just boot up the Everywhere Computer on your local machine by following our easy [Getting Started](getting-started/setup-your-local-node.md) guide.
