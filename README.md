  local-first, meaning it can survive at the extreme edge with absolutely no
  connectivity. And it handles metering and billing.

# Welcome to ϵ✵

The **Everywhere Computer (**[**ϵ✵**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]**)** lets you write complex code that runs _everywhere_ — your local machine, proprietary hyper-clouds, and everything in between. It lets you compose small, powerful functions into complex workflow logic, and execute them reliably at scale.

When you choose the Everywhere Computer, you choose the ability to:

* **Run** your own self-managed network or rent from ours
* **Write** functions in your language of choice: Rust, JS, ++
* **Compose** functions and workflows written by others
* **Extend** the network's capabilities with any UCAN[^2]-enabled service

## Why choose the Everywhere Computer?

Do you write code that is accessed over a network? The Everywhere Computer may be right for you. But, of course, you already have many ways of doing this. So when might the Everything Computer be the most appropriate choice?&#x20;

### Choose the Everywhere Computer when...

#### ...your project is threatened by:

* **Low Connectivity:** Because the Everywhere Computer runs local-first, you can continue to process compute at the edge with the resources you have at hand. As peers rendevouz or connectivity improves, that'll just become smoother and faster.
* **High Data Gravity:** A lot of data in one spot becomes cumbersome to move. We call that "data gravity". The Everywhere Computer lets compute move to your data, instead of the other way around.
* **Narrow Bandwidth Constraints:** Sometimes you simply can't run all the analysis you need on your data at the edge. The Everything Computer can be used to pre-process and select only the most important bits to send over the wire when bandwidth is scarce.
* **Low Network Throughput:** Blockchains are fantastic example of this: for _certain_ things that need global, timely consensus they work great. But not everything does. For everything else, the Everywhere Computer can deliver the verifiability you needs at a fraction of the time & cost.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** It's critical for your project to comply with regulations, but that often comes at an operational cost. It takes time and money to do achieve compliance. Whatever your compliance needs — uptime guarantees, auditability, etc — the Everywhere Computer is less resource intensive than alternatives.
* **Platform Risk:** In an environment where vendor lock-in and platform dependencies are common, the Everywhere Computer offers a decentralized and open alternative. This reduces your reliance on any single provider and mitigates risks associated with platform-specific changes, outages, or discontinuation of services.

#### ...your project needs:

* **Multi-cloud Deployments:** Whether for the regulatory compliance mentioned above, or because of legacy code or newly acquired codebases, multi-cloud deployments are a reality for many projects. Portability of the Everywhere Computer enables your company to make better use of resources and deploy a single codebase to multiple targets.
* **Mission Critical Reliability:** Control systems in mission critical environments will benefit from the Everywhere Computer's durability — replaying execution from the point of failure, and running the execution in parallel. Your software will be resilient to outages and protected against data loss.
* **Reproducible Computation:** The Everywhere Computer ensures that computations can be consistently replicated across different environments. This is crucial for scientific research, data analysis, and any application where consistency and reliability of computational results are paramount.
* **Community Maintenance:** In a project where diverse community members collectively guide and care for the system, the Everywhere Computer's portability and durability shine. It can enable all members of the community to scale their participation up and down as their resources, interest and abilities permit.
* **Credible Exit:** With the Everywhere Computer, you're not locked into a single vendor or platform, ensuring a credible exit strategy. This flexibility allows you to adapt to changing technological landscapes without the risk of being tethered to a specific vendor or technology.

## Who participates in the Everywhere Computer?

There are many ways to get involved:

* **Operators:** Because they can run _everywhere,_ Homestar nodes are ready to be operated at a wide array of scales. We encourage you to do so!
  * **Home-scale:** Run a Homestar node on your local machine or personal cloud account as we boot up the network. No matter how you participate in the Everywhere Computer, you'll start as a home-scale operator. And it's easy to do.
  * **Area-scale:** eg. factories, warehouses, communities
  * **World-scale:** eg. hyperclouds, logistics networks, global commons
* **Function Authors:** Try your hand at writing functions for the Everywhere Computer. They compile to Wasm and can be run by anyone in the network.
  * **Rust(aceans):** Rust is the native language of our Homestar nodes, and is ready for you to author in today.
  * **JavaScript:** coming soon...
  * **Python:** coming soon...
  * **More:** No language is too large or small to run on the Everywhere Computer.&#x20;
* **Front-End Devs:** Get backend capabilities that run local-first, on your users' devices, and run at scale on the Everywhere Computer when needed.
* **Service Providers:** Beyond authoring functions, and operating nodes, there are a variety of services that participants in the network will need.&#x20;
  * **Consulting Services:** Auditing, workflow optimization and custom functions are just a few examples.
  * **Tooling:** Curated registries, observability platforms and&#x20;
  * **Clouse Services (aka IaaS, BaaS, PaaS and SaaS):**  The Everywhere Computer is compatible with any UCAN-enabled service endpoint. We can help you get this done in a timely fashion.
