# Welcome to Everywhere Computer

Everywhere Computer (ϵ✵[^1]) is a network of functions and computation, with payment included.

✹ **Run** your own instance or rent from the network\
✹ **Write** functions in Rust, JS, ++\
✹ **Extend** with any UCAN-enabled service

Do you write code that is accessed over a network? Everywhere Computer may be for you. There are many ways to get involved:

✹ **Node Runners:** run a Homestar node on your home machine or personal cloud account as we boot up the network\
✹ **Rustaceans:** try your hand at writing IPVM functions. They compile to Wasm and can be run by anyone in the network.\
✹ **Front-end Devs:** Get backend capabilities that run local-first, on your users' devices — but run at scale on the Everywhere Computer when needed.

But the easiest way to answer all your questions is to just boot up the Everywhere Computer on your local machine by following our easy [Getting Started](welcome-to-everywhere-computer/getting-started.md) guide.

If you're curious about what's coming next, check out our [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/everywhere-computer/projects/1/views/1).
