# ü§ù Who Participates in the Everywhere Computer?

## **As an Operator**

Because they run _everywhere,_ Homestar nodes are ready to be operated at a wide array of scales. We encourage you to do so! At any scale, operating your nodes privately or connecting into the open Everywhere Computer network is your choice.

* **Home-scale:** Run a Homestar node on your local machine or personal cloud account as we boot up the network. No matter how you participate in the Everywhere Computer, you'll start as a home-scale operator. And it's easy to do.
* **Area-scale:** eg. factories, warehouses, neighbourhoods, cities
* **World-scale:** eg. hyperclouds, telco infrastructure, logistics networks, global commons

No matter your eventual scale, the best place to start is by [running a local node](getting-started/setup-your-local-node.md). If you'd like to learn more about area-scale and world-scale setups, book a call with us: [https://calendly.com/everywherecomputer/product](https://calendly.com/everywherecomputer/product)

## **As a Function Author**

Try your hand at writing functions and workflow templates for the Everywhere Computer. They compile to Wasm[^1] and can be run by anyone in the network.

* **Front-End Devs:** Get backend capabilities that run local-first, on your users' devices, and run at scale on the Everywhere Computer when needed.
* **Rust(aceans):** Rust is the native language of our Homestar nodes, and is ready for you to author in today.
* **JavaScript:** coming soon...&#x20;
* **Python:** coming soon...
* **BYOL (Bring Your Own Language):** For languages that support Wasm & the Wasm component model, you can write and deploy to the Everywhere Computer today. _And,_ for those that don't, the path is open for you to develop a language integration on your own by supporting Wasm & the Wasm component model.

You can get started [writing custom functions](getting-started/write-a-custom-function.md) right now, and soon we'll have a global registry for you to publish them to.

If you've got a burning need for JavaScript and Python support today, or you're interested in developing your own language integration, please book a call: [https://calendly.com/everywherecomputer/product](https://calendly.com/everywherecomputer/product)

## **As a Service Provider**&#x20;

Beyond authoring functions, and operating nodes, there are a variety of services participants in the network will need.&#x20;

* **Consulting:** Auditing, workflow optimization and custom functions are just a few examples.
* **Tooling:** Curated registries, observability platforms and IDE integrations.
* **Cloud Services (aka IaaS, BaaS, PaaS and SaaS):**  The Everywhere Computer is compatible with any UCAN-enabled service endpoint.
