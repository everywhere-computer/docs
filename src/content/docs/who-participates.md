There are many ways to get involved.

## App Developers: Save Time, Money and Headaches

Get your app deployed with high resilience, fast execution, and zero deployment. Achieve the certainty and portability you desire without needing to be a dev ops expert. Leverage a network of functions and workflows already optimized for the outcomes you need.

## Operators: Earn by Powering The Network

Connect your nodes to our open network for compensation or opt for a private setup. Operators are needed everywhere, at every scale:

* **Home-scale:** Within 5 minutes, run a node on your personal machine. Everyone starts as a home-scale operator.
* **Area-scale:** Serve one specific locale: _eg. factories, warehouses, neighbourhoods, cities._
* **World-scale:** Serve many locales: _eg. hyperclouds, telco infrastructure, logistics networks, global commons._

No matter your eventual scale, the best place to start is by [running a local node](getting-started/setup-your-local-node). If you'd like to learn more about area-scale and world-scale setups, [book a call with us](https://calendly.com/everywherecomputer/product).

## Function Authors: Monetize Your Code

Share your functions and workflows, from front-end enhancements to powerful backend capabilities that scale. Write functions in Rust, JavaScript and Python today. As more languages are supported by the [Wasm component model](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/language-support.html), they will just work.

You can get started [writing custom functions](getting-started/write-a-custom-function) right now, and soon we'll have a global registry for you to publish them to.

## Service Providers: Profit From Your Expertise

Our network thrives on diverse services: consulting, tooling, and cloud services ‚Äî if it‚Äôs [UCAN-enabled](https://ucan.xyz), it fits right in.
