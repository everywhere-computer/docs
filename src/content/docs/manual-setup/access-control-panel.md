You'll manage your Homestar node and its view of the Everywhere Computer network via the Control Panel: [control.everywhere.computer](https://control.everywhere.computer/)

Now that Everywhere Computer (via `homestar`) and IPFS (via `kubo`) are running locally, it's time to experiment by [running a workflow](../run-a-workflow).

:::note[Want to run it local?]
The exercises in our Getting Started guides are written for the hosted version of the control panel, for ease of setup. In the spirit of local-first software, of course you can also [run it locally](../control-panel/running-it-locally).
