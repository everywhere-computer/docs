The **Everywhere Computer** is powered by [Homestar](https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar) nodes â€” our implementation of the [IPVM](https://github.com/ipvm-wg) protocol.

To setup your local `Homestar` node, we highly recommend using `Node`.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Node">
Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install homestar-runtime -g
```  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="macOS">
Install `homestar` using brew by running:

```bash
brew install fission-codes/fission/homestar  
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux & Windows">
:::note
For Windows folks, using WSL2 is recommended.

1. Go to this page and scroll down to `Artifacts`: [https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar/actions/runs/7117766904](https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar/actions/runs/7117766904)
2. Download the `.zip` file for your platform - we recommend the `musl` build for linux
3. Unzip the file and move the `homestar` binary to somewhere in your path (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`)
4. Make sure the binary is executable (`chmod +x /usr/local/bin/homestar`)

## Setup your workspace

We'll store settings for your local Homestar node and the registry of functions that your workflows will run on Everywhere Computer in a workspace.

### 1. Clone the <code>getting-started</code> repo

1. Clone the repo here: https://github.com/everywhere-computer/getting-started
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the `getting-started` folder.

### 2. Add the default functions to IPFS

All functions on the Everywhere Computer are [content addressed](https://fission.codes/blog/content-addressing-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/) on IPFS, which means they are identified and located using something called a CID (Content IDentifier). This getting started workspace includes a set of image manipulation functions that our sample workflows will run.&#x20;

To add these image manipulation functions to your local IPFS node, run:

```bash
ipfs add --cid-version 1 ./functions.wasm  
```

### 3. Generate an identifying keypair

Your local Homestar node needs to be identifiable on the Everywhere Computer network. To do this, run:

```bash
openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp256k1 -outform DER -out secp256k1_key.der  
```

## Boot up the Everywhere Computer

We can now start the node by running:

```bash
homestar start -c ./settings.toml --db ./homestar.db
```
