:::tip[Before you continue]
We highly recommend following the [Quick Start](../quick-start) guide that makes use of the `every cli`, which is the path we will be putting more energy into supporting in the near future. 

However, this Manual Setup guide does contain additional information about the platform, which may be helpful for a deeper understanding of the system.
:::

This Getting Started guide will help you manually:

1. **Prepare** IPFS on your local machine â€” a dependency of the Everywhere Computer
2. **Setup** your local node
3. **Access** the Everywhere Computer control panel
4. **Run & Customize** workflows 
6. **Write** custom functions in JavaScript, Rust or Python
