The **Everywhere Computer** is powered by [Homestar](https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar) nodes â€” a reference implementation of the [IPVM](https://github.com/ipvm-wg) protocol. This guide will help you:

1. **Prepare** IPFS on your local machine â€” a dependency of the Everywhere Computer
2. **Setup** your local Homestar node
3. **Access** the Everywhere Computer control panel

## Prepare IPFS

The Everywhere Computer is both portable and durable. These two traits are made possible by [IPFSâ€™ content addressing](https://fission.codes/blog/content-addressing-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/) and WebAssembly's ability to execute in _any_ environment â€” including browsers.

### 1. Install IPFS

Just as the Everywhere Computer is powered by Homestar nodes, IPFS is powered by kubo nodes â€” the GoLang IPFS implementation. You have two options for installing it:

1. Install the kubo binary directly: [https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/#install-official-binary-distributions](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/#install-official-binary-distributions)
2. or, install IPFS Desktop GUI which includes kubo: [https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/)

### 2. Run IPFS

Make sure kubo is running! Either by launching IPFS Desktop, or running `ipfs daemon` in your terminal.

## Install Homestar

:::caution
ðŸš§ This is still under very active development! ðŸš§
:::

To install your first Everywhere Computer `Homestar` node, we recommend the cross-platform approach via npm.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Node">
Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install homestar-runtime -g
```  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="macOS">
Install `homestar` using brew by running:

```bash
brew install fission-codes/fission/homestar  
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux & Windows">
:::note
For Windows folks, using WSL2 is recommended.
:::

1. Go to this page and scroll down to `Artifacts`: [https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar/actions/runs/7117766904](https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar/actions/runs/7117766904)
2. Download the `.zip` file for your platform - we recommend the `musl` build for linux
3. Unzip the file and move the `homestar` binary to somewhere in your path (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`)
4. Make sure the binary is executable (`chmod +x /usr/local/bin/homestar`)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Setup your workspace

We'll store settings for your local Homestar node and the registry of functions that your workflows will run on Everywhere Computer in a workspace.

### 1. Clone the \'getting-started\' repo

1. Clone the repo here: https://github.com/everywhere-computer/getting-started
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the `getting-started` folder.

### 2. Add the default functions to IPFS

All functions on the Everywhere Computer are [content addressed](https://fission.codes/blog/content-addressing-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/) on IPFS, which means they are identified and located using something called a CID (Content IDentifier). This getting started workspace includes a set of image manipulation functions that our sample workflows will run.&#x20;

To add these image manipulation functions to your local IPFS node, run:

```bash
ipfs add --cid-version 1 ./functions.wasm  
```

### 3. Generate an identifying keypair

Your local Homestar node needs to be identifiable on the Everywhere Computer network. To do this, run:

```bash
openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp256k1 -outform DER -out secp256k1_key.der  
```

## Boot up the Everywhere Computer

We can now start the node by running:

```bash
homestar start -c ./settings.toml --db ./homestar.db
```

**ðŸ§Ÿ It's alive! ðŸ§Ÿ**

## Access the Control Panel

You'll manage your Homestar node and its view of the Everywhere Computer network via the Control Panel: [control.everywhere.computer](https://control.everywhere.computer/)

Now that Everywhere Computer (via `homestar`) and IPFS (via `kubo`) are running locally, it's time to experiment by [running a workflow](run-a-workflow).

:::note[Want to run it local?]
The exercises in our Getting Started guides are written for the hosted version of the control panel, for ease of setup. In the spirit of local-first software, of course you can also [run it locally](../control-panel/running-it-locally).
