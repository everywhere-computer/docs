:::tip[Before you continue]
To get setup, please follow our [Quick Start](/quick-start) guide.
:::

## Installation

```shell
npm i -g @everywhere-computer/every-cli
```

### Creating the Everywhere Computer environment

Running the Every CLI will start a [Homestar](/homestar/what-is-homestar/) node, API gateway, CloudFlare tunnel and locally running copy of the Everywhere Computer [control panel](https://control.everywhere.computer).

#### To create a single function Homestar workflow

```shell
every dev --fn <ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_FUNCTION_FILE>
```

#### To create a multi-function Homestar workflow

```shell
every dev --fn <ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_FUNCTION_FILE> --fn <ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_OTHER_FUNCTION_FILE>
```

## Function development loop

:::note
We are currently focusing on pure functions that are deterministic, and thus also cacheable anywhere within the network.

### Creating TypeScript functions

Write a TypeScript function with clearly specified argument and return types

```typescript
// hello.ts

/**
 * Hello world function that will take a `name` param and return `Hello <name>`
 */
export function hello(name: string): string {
  return `Hello ${name}`;
}
```

Start the CLI and point it to your custom TypeScript function

```shell
every cli dev --fn <ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_YOUR_FUNCTION_DIR>/hello.ts
```

### Creating Wasm components in Rust

Install the latest stable version of [Rust][install-rust]. The install should make the `cargo` and `rustup` commands available for you.

Install `cargo-component` and add the `wasm32-wasi` target:

```sh
cargo install cargo-component
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
```

Initialize a new component library:

```sh
cargo component new --lib hello
```

This command generates a `wit/world.wit` WIT world:

```wit
package component:hello;

/// An example world for the component to target.
world example {
    export hello-world: func() -> string;
}
```

It also generates Rust code in `src/lib.rs` that implements the WIT world:

```rust
#[allow(warnings)]
mod bindings;

use bindings::Guest;

struct Component;

impl Guest for Component {
    /// Say hello!
    fn hello_world() -> String {
        "Hello, World!".to_string()
    }
}

bindings::export!(Component with_types_in bindings);
```

Running a build generates a set of bindings that produce a `Guest` trait that requires us to implement the functions from the WIT world.

Build for the debug target:

```sh
cargo component build
```

Build for release:

```sh
cargo component build --release
```

The builds target `wasm32-wasi` and are compiled to `rust/target/wasm32-wasi/debug/math.wasm` and `rust/target/wasm32-wasi/release/math.wasm` respectively.

Note that the build generates `src/bindings.rs`. Check that the `wit-bindgen` version referenced at the top the file matches the `wit-bindgen-rt` version in the Cargo manifest if you see errors.

<TabItem label="Python">
### Creating Wasm components in Python

Install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Python 3.10 is the minimum required version for [`componentize-py`](https://pypi.org/project/componentize-py/).

Create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), activate the environment, and install `componentize-py`:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install componentize-py
```

Write a WIT world in a `world.wit` file:

```wit
package example:hello;

world hello {
  export hello: func() -> string;
}
```

Write an `app.py` that implements the WIT world:

```python
import hello

class Hello(hello.Hello):
    def hello(self) -> str:
        return "Hello, World!"
```

Build the Wasm component:

```sh
componentize-py -d world.wit -w hello componentize app -o hello.wasm
```

This command will produce a `hello.wasm` component.

Start the CLI and point it to your custom Wasm function

```shell
every cli dev --fn <ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_YOUR_FUNCTION_DIR>/hello.wasm
```

## Setting up a tunnel

By default the [every-cli](https://github.com/everywhere-computer/every-cli) will start a [CloudFlare tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/tunnel/) for you.

If you're familiar with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [tailscale](https://tailscale.com/), you can also use those to expose your local node server to the public Internet.

## Passing your own Homestar config

By default the [every-cli](https://github.com/everywhere-computer/every-cli) will use the [default homestar.toml values](../../config/homestar) to specify configuration settings for your Homestar node.

If you would like to specify your own `toml` file to be used as the configuration for Homestar, you can use the `--config` argument:

```shell
every cli dev --fn <ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_YOUR_FUNCTION_DIR>/hello.wasm --config ../<YOUR_CONFIG_FILE_NAME>.toml
```

You can specify as many or as few values in your `toml` file as you like and the [every-cli](https://github.com/everywhere-computer/every-cli) will prioritize the values from your config over the default values.

This means, if you only want to specify a different IPFS port, you simply need to create a `toml` file with

```toml
[node.network.ipfs]
port = 5002
```

and the [every-cli](https://github.com/everywhere-computer/every-cli) will upload your functions to IPFS on port `5002` and configure Homestar to use IPFS port `5002`, as well.

If you have specified your own config file, the control panel will run locally so its `.env` file can be overwritten if necessary:

```bash
✔ Functions parsed and compiled
✔ Homestar is running at http://127.0.0.1:8020
✔ Control Panel is running at http://127.0.0.1:5178

◐ Starting cloudflared tunnel to http://127.0.0.1:3000/
