You already have many ways of running compute over a network. When is the
  Everything Computer a good fit?

## Choose the Everywhere Computer when...

### ...your project is threatened by:

* **Low Connectivity:** Because the Everywhere Computer runs local-first, you can continue to process compute at the edge with the resources you have at hand. As peers rendevouz or connectivity improves, that'll just become smoother and faster.
* **High Data Gravity:** A lot of data in one spot becomes cumbersome to move. We call that "data gravity". The Everywhere Computer lets compute move to your data, instead of the other way around.
* **Narrow Bandwidth Constraints:** Sometimes you simply can't run all the analysis you need on your data at the edge. The Everything Computer can be used to pre-process and select only the most important bits to send over the wire when bandwidth is scarce.
* **Low Network Throughput:** Blockchains are fantastic example of this: for _certain_ things that need global, timely consensus they work great. But not everything does. For everything else, the Everywhere Computer can deliver the verifiability you needs at a fraction of the time & cost.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** It's critical for your project to comply with regulations, but that often comes at an operational cost. It takes time and money to do achieve compliance. Whatever your compliance needs â€” uptime guarantees, auditability, etc â€” the Everywhere Computer is less resource intensive than alternatives.
* **Platform Risk:** In an environment where vendor lock-in and platform dependencies are common, the Everywhere Computer offers a decentralized and open alternative. This reduces your reliance on any single provider and mitigates risks associated with platform-specific changes, outages, or discontinuation of services.

### ...your project needs:

* **Multi-cloud Deployments:** Whether for the regulatory compliance mentioned above, or because of legacy code or newly acquired codebases, multi-cloud deployments are a reality for many projects. Portability of the Everywhere Computer enables your company to make better use of resources and deploy a single codebase to multiple targets.
* **Mission Critical Reliability:** Control systems in mission critical environments will benefit from the Everywhere Computer's durability â€” replaying execution from the point of failure, and running the execution in parallel. Your software will be resilient to outages and protected against data loss.
* **Reproducible Computation:** The Everywhere Computer ensures that computations can be consistently replicated across different environments. This is crucial for scientific research, data analysis, and any application where consistency and reliability of computational results are paramount.
* **Community Maintenance:** In a project where diverse community members collectively guide and care for the system, the Everywhere Computer's portability and durability shine. It can enable all members of the community to scale their participation up and down as their resources, interest and abilities permit.
* **Credible Exit:** With the Everywhere Computer, you're not locked into a single vendor or platform, ensuring a credible exit strategy. This flexibility allows you to adapt to changing technological landscapes without the risk of being tethered to a specific vendor or technology.

In short: the Everywhere Computer can provide value any time that the portability or durability of the code you run are primary concerns.
