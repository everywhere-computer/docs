  The Everywhere Computer provides portable, durable compute. It runs
  local-first, meaning it can survive at the extreme edge with absolutely no
  connectivity. And it handles metering and billing.
---

The **Everywhere Computer** (**Ïµâœµ**) lets you run code _everywhere_ â€” your personal computer, the cloud and everything in between. Some have called it the Uber for compute.

With high resilience, fast execution, and zero deployment:
* **Write** functions in your language of choice: Rust, JS, Python, ++
* **Compose** functions and workflows written by yourself and others
* **Run** your own nodes or rent from ours
* **Extend** capabilities with any [UCAN](https://ucan.xyz)-enabled service

## It's built on open protocols

[IPVM](https://fission.codes/ipvm/), the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine, offers a seamless, secure, and open environment for WebAssembly functions. Leveraging content-addressed data, PKI, and capabilities, it ensures computational freedom and interoperability, avoiding lock-in with any single cloud provider.

[Homestar](https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar/) is the Everywhere Computer's reference implementation of the IPVM standards, written in Rust.
