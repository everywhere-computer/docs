  The Everywhere Computer provides portable, durable compute. It runs
  local-first, meaning it can survive at the extreme edge with absolutely no
  connectivity. And it handles metering and billing.

The **Everywhere Computer (**[**Ïµâœµ**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]**)** lets you write complex code that runs _everywhere_ â€” your local machine, proprietary hyper-clouds, and everything in between. It lets you compose small, powerful functions into complex workflow logic, and execute them reliably at scale.

When you choose the Everywhere Computer, you choose the ability to:

* **Run** your own self-managed network or rent from ours
* **Write** functions in your language of choice: Rust, JS, ++
* **Compose** functions and workflows written by others
* **Extend** the network's capabilities with any UCAN[^2]-enabled service

## Where do I begin?

Jump right in and follow our [Getting Started](getting-started/setup-your-local-node.md) guide to begin experimenting with a local node. If you're curious about what's coming next, check out our [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/everywhere-computer/projects/1/views/1).&#x20;
